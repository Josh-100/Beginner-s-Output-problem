# Joshua Chen's Beginner-s-Output-problem
Create a Mad-Lib:

What are Mad-Libs?
You are given a prompt (e.g. Enter a name) and the user themselves must fill this in. 
There will be multiple prompts given for multiple different objects (e.g. colour, verb) and the user must also input the corresponding values (e.g. if the prompt is ‘Enter a number’ do not put ‘Apple’) 
After these prompts are given, add them all into one string to output (print). 

Essentially, your code should be able to output this. The input is in blue: 

Welcome to Mad Libs!
What is your name? Julia
Enter an adjective (describing word): cool
Enter a verb: cook
Enter a place: home
Enter a food: cake
Enter a vehicle: car
Julia is a very cool person to be around. They love to cook in home. Their favourite food is cake which they eat in a car. 

Note that the underlined words are actually your variables. Your sentence is supposed to not make sense as well! (Note the bad grammar).
